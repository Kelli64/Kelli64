- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kelli64
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding, which sounds very broad. I am actually interested in front end developing, but thought I should start with the general and move to the more specific
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, um not sure at this point.
- 📫 How to reach me: email is preferable.
